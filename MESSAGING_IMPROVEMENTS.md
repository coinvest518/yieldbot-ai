# 🎯 YBOT Finance - Messaging Improvements Summary

## 📋 What Changed

### 1. **Hero Section (Main Landing)**
**OLD MESSAGE:**

- Direct comparison: "Traditional banks give you 0.01% interest... yBot gives you 12%+ APY"
- Highlights: AI agents, smart wallets, borrowing power

**WHY IT'S BETTER:**
✅ Immediately shows value proposition (12%+ vs 0.01%)
✅ Emphasizes credit building as PRIMARY benefit
✅ Mentions AI agents & smart wallets upfront
✅ Positions yBot as a banking alternative, not just a token

### 2. **Features Section**
